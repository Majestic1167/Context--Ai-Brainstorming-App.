After extracting and opening the project in the terminal :

Need to install all of the packages by doing [npm install] in the terminal. This will install all of the packages that are listed in the package.json file and required packages , maybe version can differ due to mac and windows.

To run project : [npm start] in the terminal if you are a user and if you are developer you need to use [npm run dev] to run the project.

For the response from LMSTUDIO:

For lmstudio you need to have this model loaded "phi-3.1-mini-128k-instruct" in lmstudio app with the correct url and ip address in the dotenv file.
